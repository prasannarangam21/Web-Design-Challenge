Analysis for Climate - Web Page from Weatherpy Exercise
-----------------------------------------------------------
1)Visualization analysis of weather in 500+ cities at different latitudes relative to the equator line. The visualizations show temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed using OpenWeatherMap API and Citypy module.
2)The temperature increases as we approach the equator. However, temperature peaks at around some degrees latitude, not exactly at the equatorial line. This may be due to the Earth's tilt in the axis known as obliquity.
3)Cloudiness and humidity do not show a strong correlation to latitude. The visualizations below show a great variety of values at similar latitudes.
4)Wind speed appears to slightly increase as we move away from the equator. We would need to go beyond the range to examine and to make a definitive conclusion.
5)From the visualizations , we can conclude temperature seems to have a clear correlation with latitude.
6)The southern hemisphere tends to be warmer than the northern hemisphere. 
7)There is no strong co relationship for latitude with cloudiness, humidity and wind speed.
